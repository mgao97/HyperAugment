# Dataset Information

This repository includes the following representative hypergraph datasets used in our study.

## 1. Cora Dataset
- **Link**: [Cora](https://relational.fel.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA)
- **Description**: The Cora dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for research in graph/hypergraph learning. It consists of 2,708 scientific papers classified into 7 categories: Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, and others. Each paper is represented as a bag-of-words vector, and the co-citation relations are represented as hyperedges. It is commonly used for tasks such as node classification and graph/hypergraph-based learning.

## 2. CA-Cora Dataset
- **Link**: [CA-Cora](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data.html)
- **Description**: The CA-Cora dataset is an extension of the Cora dataset, focusing on co-authorship relationships among the papers. It is useful for studying collaboration networks and social network analysis.

## 3. CiteSeer Dataset
- **Link**: [CiteSeer](https://linqs.org/datasets/#citeseer-doc-classification)
- **Description**: CiteSeer is another document classification dataset, consisting of 3,312 papers and 6 categories. Similar to Cora, CiteSeer uses a bag-of-words representation for the papers and serves as an important benchmark for research in document classification and citation networks.

## 4. 20Newsgroups Dataset
- **Link**: [20Newsgroups](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/113/twenty+newsgroups)
- **Description**: The 20Newsgroups dataset a collection newsgroup documents, where the nodes demote the documentations, and the hyperedges refer to the co-occurrence relationship. This dataset is widely used for text classification and clustering tasks. In 20Newsgroups, the node features are the TF-IDF representations of news messages.

## 5. House Committees Dataset
- **Link**: [HouseCommittees](https://gitlab.com/easy-graph/easygraph-data-house-committees)
- **Description**: This dataset is a collaboration networks, which contains structural information about the committees of the U.S. House of Representatives, suitable for social network analysis.

## 6. Senate Bills Dataset
- **Link**: [SenateBills](https://gitlab.com/easy-graph/easygraph-data-senate-committees)
- **Description**: This dataset is built on the relationships between senators regarding the support of various legislative bills. It is suitable for political network analysis and bill propagation studies.
