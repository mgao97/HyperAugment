# Dataset Information

This repository includes the following datasets:

## 1. Cora Dataset
- **Link**: [Cora](https://relational.fel.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA)
- **Description**: The Cora dataset is a widely used benchmark for research in machine learning and graph theory. It consists of 2,708 scientific papers classified into 7 categories: Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, and others. Each paper is represented as a bag-of-words vector, and the dataset also includes citation links, allowing for the exploration of citation networks. It is commonly used for tasks such as node classification and graph-based learning.

## 2. CA-Cora Dataset
- **Link**: [CA-Cora](https://deephypergraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/dhg/data/coauthorship.html)
- **Description**: The CA-Cora dataset is an extension of the Cora dataset, focusing on co-authorship relationships among the papers. It is useful for studying collaboration networks and social network analysis.

## 3. CiteSeer Dataset
- **Link**: [CiteSeer](https://linqs.org/datasets/#citeseer-doc-classification)
- **Description**: CiteSeer is another document classification dataset, consisting of 3,312 papers and 6 categories. Similar to Cora, CiteSeer uses a bag-of-words representation for the papers and serves as an important benchmark for research in document classification and citation networks.

## 4. 20Newsgroups Dataset
- **Link**: [20Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)
- **Description**: The 20Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, organized into 20 different newsgroups. It is widely used for text classification and clustering tasks.

## 5. House Committees Dataset
- **Link**: [House Committees](https://gitlab.com/easy-graph/easygraph-data-house-committees)
- **Description**: This dataset contains structural information about the committees of the U.S. House of Representatives, suitable for social network analysis and graph theory research. It provides data on the relationships and interactions among committee members.

## 6. Senate Bills Dataset
- **Link**: [Senate Bills](https://gitlab.com/easy-graph/easygraph-data-senate-committees)
- **Description**: This dataset includes information related to U.S. Senate bills, suitable for political network analysis and bill propagation studies. It contains data on bill texts, voting records, and more.
